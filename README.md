# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Prediction Project

## Description
This project focuses on the prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to provide insights into the likelihood of ASD in individuals.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is stored in `ASD_data.csv`. It contains various features related to individuals, including gender, jaundice history, autism diagnosis, and more. Data preprocessing has been performed to clean the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

## Model Training
We have employed logistic regression to build a predictive model for ASD risk. The model's performance is assessed using accuracy and cross-validation scores. A confusion matrix and classification report are included for in-depth analysis.
